{"name":"Storage Performance Analyzer","tagline":"","body":"## Description \r\nThe **Storage Performance Analyzer (SPA)** is a software package containing the functionality for the systematic measurement, analysis and regression modeling specifically tailored for storage systems. SPA consists of a benchmark harness that coordinates and controls the execution of the included I/O benchmarks (<a href=\"https://github.com/FFSB-prime\" target=\"_blank\">FFSB</a> and <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/filebench/\" target=\"_blank\">Filebench</a>) and a tailored analysis library used to process and evaluate the collected measurements.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark harness supports the execution of benchmarks. Using a specification of the benchmark parameter space, which should be run on the remote machine, the software ensures that each of these configurations is executed automatically in a deterministic order. Furthermore, the benchmark harness supports synchronous measurements on co-located virtual machines in virtualized environments. The software ensures that the benchmark results are stored persistently in an SQLite database to provide easy access for further analysis.\r\n\r\nThe analysis library provides the functionality for the analysis of the measurement results obtained with the benchmark harness. By providing a drop-in solution for the widely accepted statistical framework R, the power of R is combined with the specialized functionality of SPA. The analysis functions help with the derivation and analysis of regression models from the benchmark results. It also contains functionality to optimize many regression techniques to maximize the modeling power in different scenarios. The R environment can be exploited to further analyze the measurements and to generate illustrations of the analysis results. <br>\r\n<img alt=\"Spa-setup.png\" src=\"https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/mediawiki-sdq-extern/images/5/57/Spa-setup.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" align=\"center\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Information \r\n###  Lead \r\n * <a href=\"http://sdq.ipd.kit.edu/people/qais_noorshams/\" target=\"_blank\"> Qais Noorshams </a> <br> \r\n * <a href=\"http://se.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/staff/kounev_samuel/\" target=\"_blank\"> Samuel Kounev </a>\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n  * <a href=\"mailto:dominik@dbruhn.de\"> Dominik Bruhn </a>  <br> \r\n  * <a href=\"http://sdq.ipd.kit.edu/people/axel_busch/\" target=\"_blank\"> Axel Busch </a>  <br> \r\n  * <a href=\"http://se.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/staff/kounev_samuel/\" target=\"_blank\"> Samuel Kounev </a> <br> \r\n  * <a href=\"http://sdq.ipd.kit.edu/people/qais_noorshams/\" target=\"_blank\"> Qais Noorshams </a> <br> \r\n  * <a href=\"http://sdq.ipd.kit.edu/people/ralf_reussner/\" target=\"_blank\"> Ralf Reussner </a><br> \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n### Controller Machine\r\n   * Java 6 or later, Apache Ant for compilation <br>\r\n   * Windows, Unix and Mac operating systems tested <br>\r\n   * R (http://r-project.org) <br>\r\n   * SQLite (http://sqlite.org) <br>\r\n\r\n### System Under Test\r\n   * POSIX compatible operating system (tested on Linux) <br>\r\n   * SSH access from the controller machine  <br>\r\n\r\n## Version \r\n   * 1.0\r\n\r\n## Download \r\n### Download\r\n   * SPA can be downloaded with documentation <a href=\"https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/eclipse/spa/releases/\" target=\"_blank\">from here</a>. <br>\r\n   * Prepared drops (already generated model code and installed plugins) for Linux, Mac OS, and Windows can be downloaded <a href=\"https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/eclipse/spa/drops/\" target=\"_blank\">from here</a>. <br>\r\n   * If you have any questions, please contact <a href=\"http://sdq.ipd.kit.edu/people/qais_noorshams/\" target=\"_blank\">Qais Noorshams</a>.\r\n\r\n### SPEC Research Group Tool \r\n<img alt=\"SPECreseach-logo-SM.png\" src=\"https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/mediawiki-sdq-extern/images/4/4c/SPECreseach-logo-SM.png\" width=\"36\" height=\"62\" />\r\n   * SPA is a SPEC RG tool and available in the <a href=\"http://research.spec.org/tools/\" target=\"_blank\"> SPEC RG repository of peer-reviewed tools </a>. \r\n\r\n## License \r\n   * GPLv2 or later\r\n\r\n## Publications using the tool \r\n1.

Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n-->","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
